## Profitability and Yield prediction on agricultural crops of India
The scope of this project is to investigate a dataset of crop records for the agricultural sector using machine learning techniques. Identifying crop predictions by farmers is more difficult. We try to reduce this risk factor behind selection of the crop.

### Datasets 
1. `datafile.csv` One finds out the profit and classifies it if there is profit or loss. 
2. `crop_production.csv` The second dataset predicts the production.
